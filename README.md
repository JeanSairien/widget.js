Spear.js - The lightweight JavaScript widget framework
======================================================

[Read the documentation here](http://spearjs.readthedocs.org/)

Spear.js is a lightweight framework in JavaScript to separate web applications in multiples manageable components called
widgets.

Spear.js is not a full featured framework that can handle all aspects of a web application like network communications
or routing, there already exists good libraries for that. Spear.js only handles one aspect of web development:
separation of visual components into independant entities. So it provides only features to serve that goal, namely
widgets, lifecycle management and events.
