widget.js - The lightweight JavaScript widget framework
======================================================

[Read the documentation here](http://widgetjs.readthedocs.org/)

widget.js is a lightweight framework in JavaScript to separate web applications in multiples reusable components called
widgets.

widget.js is not a full featured framework that can handle all aspects of a web application like network communications
or routing, there already exists good libraries for that. widget.js only handles one aspect of web development:
separation of visual components into independant entities. So it provides only features to serve that goal, namely
widgets, lifecycle management and events.

To install with its depencies:

    bower install widget
